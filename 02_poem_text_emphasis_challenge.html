        <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, <em>certainly can’t do algebra.</em><br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <em>Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</em><br>
        And <em>Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs</em> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <strong>we are born to learn.</strong><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You <em>stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail </em> and fall.<br>
        <strong>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</strong><br>
        Until one day, <strong>you walk.</strong><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each <em>wrong answer</em> making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        <strong>Failing is just another word for growing.</strong> And you <strong>keep going.</strong><br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that <em> you don’t get it.</em> <br>
        You just don’t get it, <strong>yet</strong>.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on <strong>basic ideas</strong> that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <em> Whoever you are, wherever you are.</em> <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything</strong>.
